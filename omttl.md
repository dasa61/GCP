# 10.01.2023 Introduction to Digital Transformation with Google Cloud: ML & AI
- To create value in your business you need to use the data to make decisisons for future business. 
- AI is a broad field or term that describes any kind of machine capable of task that normally requires human intelligence such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision making or translation between languages.
- ML is certain branch within the field of AI. Specifically ML refers to computers that can learn from data ana make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. This is done using algorithms or models to analyze data. These algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.
- Throughout the module: ML is a way to standard **algorithms** or standard models to analyze **data** in order to derive **predictive insights** and make repeated **decisions** at scale.
- ML: put simply it's a way of teaching a computer how to solve problems by feeding it examples of correct answers. 
- The purpose of ML in a business is the same as all aother disruptive new technologies to enable organizations to better achieve their missions.
# 10.01.2023 Introduction to Digital Transformation with Google Cloud: Data Quality
- The best data has threee qualities:It has **coverage** to its **clean**er consistent and three it's **complete**.
  - Data Coverage: Referes to the scope of a problem domain and all possible scenarios it can account for in other words, all possible input and output data.
  - Data Cleanliness: sometimes called **data consistency**. Data is considered dirty or inconsistent if it includes or exclude anything that might prevent an ML model from making accurate predictions.
  - Data Completeness: This refers to the availability of sufficient data about the world to replace human knowledge. 
- Incomplete data can limit the performance of ML model:
  - Lack of availability of better data
  - Mistaken expectation about how ML works
  - Poor execution of programm design and implementation
# 10.01.2023 Introduction to Digital Transformation with Google Cloud: AI & ML with GC
- VertixAI: to manage and build your ML projects. It brings together google cloud services for building ML under one unified user interface. 
- Three ML approaches
  -  Pre-trained APIs: if you don't have your own training data, you'll use google cloud . Pretrain APIs a great option if you don't have specialzed data scientists but do have business analysts and developers. 
  -  Pre-trained APIs can be divided into four categories 
    -    Site 
    -    Language
    -    Conversation
    -    Structured Data
  -  AutoML
  -  Custom Model Tooling
# 10.01.2023 Introduction to Digital Transformation with Google Cloud: usecases for ML
- Usecase 1: Replacing rule-based systems
  -  Search is one example of how ML leverage vast amount of data to provide highly accurate predictions in a rule based system.
- Automating processes
  -  Where ML makes predictions and repeated decisions at scale.
- Understanding unstructure data
  - Like Images, Videos, Audio.  
- Personalizing applications
  - like YouTube  
- *** Wherever there is data, there is inherent human bias. Make sure to build in ethical and responsible best practices. 
# 10.01.2023 Innovation with Data and Google Cloud
- ABC

# 10.01.2023 Infrastructure and Application Modernzation with Google Cloud
- Module 1
  - Virtual machines
  - Containerization
  - Serveless Computing 
- Module 2
  - Application Modernization
  - App Engine
- Module 3
  - All present application programming interfaces or APIs and explain how they unlock value from legacy systems, enabale businesses to create new value and monetize new services. 
# 11.01.2023 Infra&App Modernzation with GC: Module 1
- Modernizing IT Infra with GC
  -  New businesses born in the cloud are challanging old business models. Scale is no longer a competetive advantage, it's the Norm. 
    - How organizations can respond to this trend?
    - How can they survive and thrive in this new clud era?
    -  With cloud organizations can develop and build new applications to drive better engagement with customers and employees. Faster securely and at scale and unlimately leveraging cloud technology to truly transform a business requires new collaborative models, changing cluscure and processes and enabling team productivity and innovation.
  - VMs share the same pool of computers proccessing storage and networking resources. VMs optimize the use of available resources and enable businesses to have multiple applications running at the same time on a server in a way that is efficient and manageable. 
-  Available compute options
-  Private, hybrid and multi-cloud architectures
-  Goggle Cloud global Infrastructure
-  Google Cloud compute solutions

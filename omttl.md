- also known as the age of Cloud Technology.
- Kondratieff Waves or Innovation waves.
- Cloud technology is transforming how businesses create value, how people work, and ultimately how people live.
- Cloud technology is generating thousands of new innovations such as chatbots and predictive medicine.
- What is Clode? The cloud is a metaphor for the network of data centers that store and compute infirmation available through the internet. Essentially, instead of decribimg a complex web of software, computers, network, and security systems, all of that has been combined into one word, Cloud.
- When we talk about cloud computing, we're talking about the technology and processes needed to store, manage, and access data that is transferred over the cloud rather than the data that remains on your computer's hard drive.
- Cloud enables and redefines our ability to **collaborate**, **perceive**, **categorize**, **predict**, and **recommend** in every industry for every activity.
- Moore's Law has been disrupted twice by radical new designs and chips. The first disruption comes from processes that are specifically meant for this type of application in which we call TPUs, or Tensor Processing Units. According to Moore's Law, TPUs should be twice as powerful as the preceding processing units, but they are not. 
-  Why is data needed to unlock the capabilities of cloud?
-  
- Today we can build highly accurate statistical model to predict complex behaviors and use that information to anticipate intent. This is most profound aspect of the cloud revelotion. 
- In addition to its predictive capabilities, the cloud delivers high performance analytics and enables businesses to reduce equipment downtime, achieve more accurate supply planning, and maintain leaner operational organizations that have more efficient systems and less wast. 
- The power of Cloud also changes the way we work by automating processes and creating open and real-time collaboration opportunities between people globally.
- in the context of cloude, compute is an ability to process information to store, retrive, compare, and analyze it and automate tasks most often done by a computer program. Compute power, therefore, refers to the speed at which a computer is able to process data.

# 10.01.2023 Introduction to Digital Transformation with Google Cloud: ML & AI
- To create value in your business you need to use the data to make decisisons for future business. 
- AI is a broad field or term that describes any kind of machine capable of task that normally requires human intelligence such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision making or translation between languages.
- ML is certain branch within the field of AI. Specifically ML refers to computers that can learn from data ana make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. This is done using algorithms or models to analyze data. These algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.
- Throughout the module: ML is a way to standard **algorithms** or standard models to analyze **data** in order to derive **predictive insights** and make repeated **decisions** at scale.
- ML: put simply it's a way of teaching a computer how to solve problems by feeding it examples of correct answers. 
- The purpose of ML in a business is the same as all aother disruptive new technologies to enable organizations to better achieve their missions.
# 10.01.2023 Introduction to Digital Transformation with Google Cloud: Data Quality
- The best data has threee qualities:It has **coverage** to its **clean**er consistent and three it's **complete**.
  - Data Coverage: Referes to the scope of a problem domain and all possible scenarios it can account for in other words, all possible input and output data.
  - Data Cleanliness: sometimes called **data consistency**. Data is considered dirty or inconsistent if it includes or exclude anything that might prevent an ML model from making accurate predictions.
  - Data Completeness: This refers to the availability of sufficient data about the world to replace human knowledge. 
- Incomplete data can limit the performance of ML model:
  - Lack of availability of better data
  - Mistaken expectation about how ML works
  - Poor execution of programm design and implementation
# 10.01.2023 Introduction to Digital Transformation with Google Cloud: AI & ML with GC
- VertixAI: to manage and build your ML projects. It brings together google cloud services for building ML under one unified user interface. 
- Three ML approaches
  -  Pre-trained APIs: if you don't have your own training data, you'll use google cloud . Pretrain APIs a great option if you don't have specialzed data scientists but do have business analysts and developers. 
  -  Pre-trained APIs can be divided into four categories 
    -    Site 
    -    Language
    -    Conversation
    -    Structured Data
  -  AutoML
  -  Custom Model Tooling
# 10.01.2023 Introduction to Digital Transformation with Google Cloud: usecases for ML
- Usecase 1: Replacing rule-based systems
  -  Search is one example of how ML leverage vast amount of data to provide highly accurate predictions in a rule based system.
- Automating processes
  -  Where ML makes predictions and repeated decisions at scale.
- Understanding unstructure data
  - Like Images, Videos, Audio.  
- Personalizing applications
  - like YouTube  
- *** Wherever there is data, there is inherent human bias. Make sure to build in ethical and responsible best practices.

# 11.01.2023 Infra&App Modernzation with GC: Module 1
- Modernizing IT Infra with GC
  -  New businesses born in the cloud are challanging old business models. Scale is no longer a competetive advantage, it's the Norm. 
    - How organizations can respond to this trend?
    - How can they survive and thrive in this new clud era?
    -  With cloud organizations can develop and build new applications to drive better engagement with customers and employees. Faster securely and at scale and unlimately leveraging cloud technology to truly transform a business requires new collaborative models, changing cluscure and processes and enabling team productivity and innovation.
  - VMs share the same pool of computers proccessing storage and networking resources. VMs optimize the use of available resources and enable businesses to have multiple applications running at the same time on a server in a way that is efficient and manageable. 

- *** Key advantages of using public cloud services to modernize or even set up your IT infrastructure. 
  - First, Cloud reduces the need for IT team to act a gateway to technocal resources such as network security, compute power and data. 
  - Next, there is a board network access. 
  - Third, Resources are distributed across a global network of data centers (Resource Pooling)
  - Next, Companies can scale up or down instantly due to the availability of on demand cloud resources (Repid Elasticity). Means business can serve their customers without intruption in a coast effective way. 
  - Finally, cloud is a measured service which means companies have a lower up front or capital expenditure because they don't have the need to purchase their own data center equipment or maintain their IT Infra. 
 - *** What options are available to modernize your Business IT Infra:
  - VMs: is a form of resource optimization that allows multiple systems to run on the same hardware. Means they share the same pool of computer processing storage and networking resources. VMs enable business to have multiple applications running at the same time on a server in a way that is efficient and managable. The software layer that enables this is called a Hyper Visor. A Hyper Visor sits on top of physical hardware, and multiple VMs are buolt on top of it. 
  - Containerization
    -  It provides isolated environements to run your software for services and optimize resources from one piece of hardware
  - Serverless computing
    - It offers a far more lightweight unit for developers and IT Operations team to work and provide a ranfe of benefits.  They start Faster and use a fraction of the memory compared to booting an entire operating system. 
    - It gives developers the ability to create prediccatable environments that are isolated from other obligations.
    - Containers improve agility, strength and security, optimize resources and simplify managing applications in the cloud. 
    - Container are able to run virtually anywhere which makes development and deployment easy. They can run on Linux, Windows, Mac, VM, Bare Metal, Developer's Machine, on-premises data center, pulic Cloud.
    - Container improve Agility, strength and security, optimize resources, and simplfy managing applications in the cloud. 
    - Kubernetes: an open-source cluster management system that provides automated container orchestration. It improve application reliability, faster, more agile application development, peace of mind

# 10.01.2023 Introduction to Digital Transformation with Google Cloud: ML & AI
- To create value in your business you need to use the data to make decisisons for future business. 
- AI is a broad field or term that describes any kind of machine capable of task that normally requires human intelligence such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision making or translation between languages.
- ML is certain branch within the field of AI. Specifically ML refers to computers that can learn from data ana make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. This is done using algorithms or models to analyze data. These algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.
- Throughout the module: ML is a way to standard **algorithms** or standard models to analyze **data** in order to derive **predictive insights** and make repeated **decisions** at scale.
- ML: put simply it's a way of teaching a computer how to solve problems by feeding it examples of correct answers. 
- The purpose of ML in a business is the same as all aother disruptive new technologies to enable organizations to better achieve their missions.
# 10.01.2023 Introduction to Digital Transformation with Google Cloud: Data Quality
- The best data has threee qualities:It has **coverage** to its **clean**er consistent and three it's **complete**.
  - Data Coverage: Referes to the scope of a problem domain and all possible scenarios it can account for in other words, all possible input and output data.
  - Data Cleanliness: sometimes called **data consistency**. Data is considered dirty or inconsistent if it includes or exclude anything that might prevent an ML model from making accurate predictions.
  - Data Completeness: This refers to the availability of sufficient data about the world to replace human knowledge. 
- Incomplete data can limit the performance of ML model:
  - Lack of availability of better data
  - Mistaken expectation about how ML works
  - Poor execution of programm design and implementation
# 10.01.2023 Introduction to Digital Transformation with Google Cloud: AI & ML with GC
- VertixAI: to manage and build your ML projects. It brings together google cloud services for building ML under one unified user interface. 
- Three ML approaches
  -  Pre-trained APIs: if you don't have your own training data, you'll use google cloud . Pretrain APIs a great option if you don't have specialzed data scientists but do have business analysts and developers. 
  -  Pre-trained APIs can be divided into four categories 
    -    Site 
    -    Language
    -    Conversation
    -    Structured Data
  -  AutoML
  -  Custom Model Tooling
# 10.01.2023 Introduction to Digital Transformation with Google Cloud: usecases for ML
- Usecase 1: Replacing rule-based systems
  -  Search is one example of how ML leverage vast amount of data to provide highly accurate predictions in a rule based system.
- Automating processes
  -  Where ML makes predictions and repeated decisions at scale.
- Understanding unstructure data
  - Like Images, Videos, Audio.  
- Personalizing applications
  - like YouTube  
- *** Wherever there is data, there is inherent human bias. Make sure to build in ethical and responsible best practices.

# 10.01.2023 Infrastructure and Application Modernzation with Google Cloud
- Module 1
  - Virtual machines
  - Containerization
  - Serveless Computing 
- Module 2
  - Application Modernization
  - App Engine
- Module 3
  - All present application programming interfaces or APIs and explain how they unlock value from legacy systems, enabale businesses to create new value and monetize new services. 
# 11.01.2023 Infra&App Modernzation with GC: Module 1
- Modernizing IT Infra with GC
  -  New businesses born in the cloud are challanging old business models. Scale is no longer a competetive advantage, it's the Norm. 
    - How organizations can respond to this trend?
    - How can they survive and thrive in this new clud era?
    -  With cloud organizations can develop and build new applications to drive better engagement with customers and employees. Faster securely and at scale and unlimately leveraging cloud technology to truly transform a business requires new collaborative models, changing cluscure and processes and enabling team productivity and innovation.
  - VMs share the same pool of computers proccessing storage and networking resources. VMs optimize the use of available resources and enable businesses to have multiple applications running at the same time on a server in a way that is efficient and manageable. 

- *** Key advantages of using public cloud services to modernize or even set up your IT infrastructure. 
  - First, Cloud reduces the need for IT team to act a gateway to technocal resources such as network security, compute power and data. 
  - Next, there is a board network access. 
  - Third, Resources are distributed across a global network of data centers (Resource Pooling)
  - Next, Companies can scale up or down instantly due to the availability of on demand cloud resources (Repid Elasticity). Means business can serve their customers without intruption in a coast effective way. 
  - Finally, cloud is a measured service which means companies have a lower up front or capital expenditure because they don't have the need to purchase their own data center equipment or maintain their IT Infra. 
 - *** What options are available to modernize your Business IT Infra:
  - VMs: is a form of resource optimization that allows multiple systems to run on the same hardware. Means they share the same pool of computer processing storage and networking resources. VMs enable business to have multiple applications running at the same time on a server in a way that is efficient and managable. The software layer that enables this is called a Hyper Visor. A Hyper Visor sits on top of physical hardware, and multiple VMs are buolt on top of it. 
  - Containerization
    -  It provides isolated environements to run your software for services and optimize resources from one piece of hardware
  - Serverless computing
    - It offers a far more lightweight unit for developers and IT Operations team to work and provide a ranfe of benefits.  They start Faster and use a fraction of the memory compared to booting an entire operating system. 
    - It gives developers the ability to create prediccatable environments that are isolated from other obligations.
    - Containers improve agility, strength and security, optimize resources and simplify managing applications in the cloud. 
    - Container are able to run virtually anywhere which makes development and deployment easy. They can run on Linux, Windows, Mac, VM, Bare Metal, Developer's Machine, on-premises data center, pulic Cloud.
    - Container improve Agility, strength and security, optimize resources, and simplfy managing applications in the cloud. 
    - Kubernetes: an open-source cluster management system that provides automated container orchestration. It improve application reliability, faster, more agile application development, peace of mind
  - Serverless computing: means that resources such as compute power are automatically provisions behind the scenes as needed.  
-  Available compute options
-  Private, hybrid and multi-cloud architectures
-  Google Cloud global Infrastructure
-  Google Cloud compute solutions

# 11.01.2023 Infra&App Modernzation with GC: Key terms
- in the context of cloud- compute or computing refers to a machine's ability to process information to store, retrive, compare and analyze it and automate tasks often done by computer programms otherwise known as software or applications.

# 19.01.2023 Infra&App Modernzation with GC: Cloud Change Patterns
- Five identified common patterns that business can adopt when they want to modernize their applications.
  -  Move applications first and then change them 
  -  Change applications before they move
  -  Invent in greenfield
  -  Invent in brownfield
  -  Move applications without any changes
# 11.01.2023 Infra&App Modernzation with GC: Module 3
# 22.01.2023 Understanding Google Cloud Security and Operations:Finanancial Governance in Cloud
- When it comes to cloud cost management consider followwing questions:
  - What cloud resources are being used and whom?
  - What are associated resource cost?
  - How  do these cost measure against the broader business strategy?
  - With cloud an organization can and should monitor and analyze its cloud usage and cost on a daily, or weekly basis?
# 22.01.2023 Understanding Google Cloud Security and Operations:Total Cost of Ownership
- TCO refers to comprehensive assessment of all of the layers whithin the Infra and other associated cost accross the business over time. This is includes acquiring hardware and software, management and support, communication, and user expenses and the cost of service downtime, training, and other productivity losses.
